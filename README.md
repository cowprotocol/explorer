# Gnosis Protocol UI

`Gnosis Protocol UI` contains some reusable components for [Gnosis Protocol](https://docs.gnosis.io/protocol) (`üö® WARNING: the doc may still refer to v1 of the protocol`).

Gnosis Protocol is a fully permissionless DEX that enables ring trades to maximize liquidity.

`Gnosis Protocol UI` contains:

- **Explorer**: Gnosis Protocol explorer. Allows you to explore the protocol orders and trades. For now Explorer is a WIP üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
- **Trade**: Classical trading interface. For now it is just a WIP üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
- **Legacy GP v1 UI**: Trading interface for Gnosis Protocol v1. It's the only app that is not generated automatically, but it can be run/built by following the instructions in this readme.
- **Story Book**: Showcases some of the components used in these apps.

## Orderbook API Endpoints

Fee quote requests and posting orders are sent to the Orderbook API. This API has the responsibility of collecting orders and
handing them to the solvers.

The reference implementation of the API is [CoW Protocol Services](https://github.com/cowprotocol/services).

The API endpoint is configured using the environment variable `REACT_APP_ORDER_BOOK_URLS`:

```ini
REACT_APP_ORDER_BOOK_URLS={"1":"https://YOUR_HOST","100":"https://YOUR_HOST","5":"https://YOUR_HOST"}
